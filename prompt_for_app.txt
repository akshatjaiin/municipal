modify the prompt to Unified Civic Issue Detection & Grievance Redressal Platform
Cities face frequent civic issues like potholes, waste accumulation, broken streetlights, and animal carcasses on the road. Reporting is slow, manual, and often unclear about responsibility. Participants must develop a unified reporting system where citizens can upload issues with location and photos, and municipalities can manage workflows, track resolution, and ensure accountability. This includes features for reporting non-functional streetlights, tracking maintenance staff attendance, and monitoring cleanliness of public toilets and govt facilities. so i can make a app user site while following the required form data
